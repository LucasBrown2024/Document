## Introduction

The traditional web2 gaming market, with global annual sales of over $400Bn, is larger than the film and music industries combined. Thus, it’s no surprise that gaming-specific blockchains have been a well-researched area, pioneered by companies such as ImmutableX ($5Bn market cap), Ronin ($3Bn), Beam ($2Bn), Oasys ($1Bn), and WAX ($250M). Noticeably, though, they all compromise on security or decentralization in favor of the scalability needed in gaming. The scalability trilemma is a complex problem to solve, after all. Beyond scalability, most of the existing gaming-specific blockchains did not architect for the rise of fully onchain games(FOCGs), the new chapter of blockchain gaming that many crypto experts like Paradigm have written [pieces](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/08/onchain-games) about.

At Adventure Gold DAO, we are the first to launch a blockchain specific for fully onchain gaming. Our roots stem from Loot, the first composable NFT issued on August 27th, 2021, by Dom Hoffmann. Adventure Gold ($AGLD), which governs the DAO, is the token behind Loot and was airdropped to owners of the Loot NFTs on August 29th, 2021, as an entirely fair launch token. Since its inception, AGLD has inspired a community of fully onchain games and autonomous world builders. The token is traded on exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, and OKX. AGLD has been the subject of research from [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/learn/market-updates/around-the-block-issue-17), [Bybit](https://learn.bybit.com/altcoins/what-is-adventure-gold-agld-loot-nft-project/), and more.

Adventure Gold DAO’s first blockchain built in 2023 was Loot Chain, which was the world’s first chain dedicated to FOCGs and aimed to bring sovereignty to the Loot and AGLD communities. Despite our limited resources as a fully decentralized DAO with zero VC backing or a functional treasury, we were committed to solving scalability & adoption for users of fully onchain games. Building Loot Chain, an L2 built with Caldera on the OP stack using Polygon as the DA layer, helped us realize the massive underserved market for developers building for this new chapter of web3. 

A FOCG executes all of its state transitions and logic on a blockchain, usually represented via changes in the ECS system. This means the entire world state, updated via a ticker system, runs on a distributed ledger. A player's every move, win, and loss are onchain. A developer’s every modification to the game is also onchain. We realized that Loot Chain was a good start, but we needed to build a much more scalable and developer-centric Layer 2 blockchain that could grow alongside this new sector for the next five years. Thus, **the Adventure Layer** was born - an Ethereum Layer 2 that implements several designs that are tried and true in existing L1s and L2s while also adding innovative designscustom-made for FOCGs. 


## Project Overview

**The Adventure Layer** is a groundbreaking initiative in the domain of blockchain technology, specially designed to cater to the increasing demands of the web3 gaming industry. As an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network, **The Adventure Layer leverages unique sharding technology to facilitate horizontally scaling solutions and introduces theoretically infinite transactions per second (TPS)** with ultra-low gas fees to the current crypto gaming realm. It also introduced game libraries and tool kits designed specifically to make building FOCGs easier. The primary goal of this initiative is to provide the crypto gaming industry with an ultimate solution to the enduring scalability challenges that have historically hindered blockchain applications in high-demanding scenarios within gaming.

In the landscape of digital gaming, transactions need to be swift and efficient to maintain an engaging user experience. Further, for FOCGs, state transitions and logic need to be handled with precision and modularity, while developer tool kits specifically crafted for onchain games need to be designed. The traditional blockchain architectures often need these requirements, particularly under the strain of high transaction volumes typical of popular games. **The Adventure Layer** addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative platform designed to support FOCGs through a specialized game engine deployed natively across its sharded blockchain.

*Key concepts integral to **the Adventure Layer***

- **Layer 2 (L2)**: Networks that build on the existing blockchain (Layer 1) to enhance performance and scalability.
    
- **Sharding**: A method of splitting a database to spread the load across multiple servers, thus enhancing transaction throughput.
    
- **Fully Onchain Games(FOCGs)**: A gaming architecture where all aspects of the game, including state management and logic, are processed on the blockchain.
    
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: An architectural pattern used in game development that promotes greater flexibility and scalability in managing game entities and their behaviors.
    


## Problem Statement

Traditional blockchain platforms offer security and decentralization but are often plagued by inherent limitations in scalability and efficient transaction processing. This issue is particularly noticeable in the context of fully onchain blockchain gaming, where the demand for rapid state updates, high transaction throughput, and modularity is critical.

Previous efforts to incorporate sharding in blockchain structures mainly faced obstacles due to insufficient infrastructure, including a lack of robust mechanisms to maintain state consistency and facilitate effective communication between shards.

Scalable sovereignty is one of the most important requirements for games, especially FOCGs (free-to-own and creator gas-efficient games). We understand it's extremely difficult to build a successful game. It would be even harder if, after finally obtaining decent user engagement, the chain grinds to a halt due to an NFT launch in which the entire gas limit is consumed by minting transactions. Therefore, it is crucial that a game can effectively have its own dedicated blockspace if it chooses to. Since FOCGs naturally require more blockspace to run, it is increasingly vital for each game to have its own sovereign scalability. 

At the same time, composability cannot be compromised since it is one of the most important reasons for building a fully onchain game. Having community-building User Generated Content (UGC) such as metagames and tools that sustain value is only possible if all the logic and state of the game are available in a trustless and modular way onchain. Effectively, the game should maintain composability with other ecosystem parts. Games should resemble countries on the same planet where tourists, builders, and traders can travel between them seamlessly and leave their unique mark.

The only way to ensure scalable sovereignty and composability is via sharding, with optimization on cross-shard communication and effective settlement. Historically, sharding implementations encountered several challenges:

- **Cross-Shard Communication**: Ensure the efficient and reliable processing of transactions that involve multiple shards.
    
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain a unified view of the state across various shards without incurring prohibitive overheads.
    
- **Infrastructure Overheads**: Implement a complex sharded system with adequate support for seamless operation and maintenance.
    

These challenges often led to fragmented ecosystems, where the potential scalability advantages of sharding were offset by increased complexity and decreased overall system efficiency.

Lastly, the tooling and developer kits for onchain gaming are limited at best.

  

## Architecture of The Adventure Layer

#### The Adventure Layer as an Optimistic Rollup

**The Adventure Layer** is built upon an optimistic rollup framework chosen for its efficiency and compatibility with Ethereum L1. This layer serves as the base where transactions are batched and executed off-chain, with final state commitments made on Ethereum L1. This setup ensures that the core operations benefit from the security of the main Ethereum network while operating at greater speed and at a lower cost.

#### Validator Dynamics within The Adventure Layer

Validators validate both L2 and the shards for **The Adventure Layer**:

- **Validating L2**: Validators validate the transactions and state transitions on the L2 optimistic rollup.
    
- **Validating Shards**: Validators validate the transactions within local shards.
    

The integrity of this dual-validation mechanism is maintained through a rigorous incentive system:

- **Rewards**: Validators receive rewards for each successful validation, encouraging them to accurately process transactions and state transitions.
    
- **Slashing**: Validators stand to lose a portion of their staked tokens if they fail to correctly validate either the L2 or any of the localized shards, ensuring a high degree of accountability.
    

### Shard-Sharing State: A Novel EVM Sharding Infrastructure

**The Adventure Layer** introduces the **Shard-Sharing State** to overcome traditional challenges with sharding, such as interoperability and state consistency. This innovative sharding infrastructure is native to **the Adventure Layer** L2 but facilitates seamless read/write operations across both the L2 and individual shards. The Shard-Sharing State significantly enhances interoperability and allows for efficient state management across the network.

### Data Availability and State Settlement

Shards within **The Adventure Layer** utilize blob storage for data availability (DA), ensuring data integrity and accessibility with minimal gas costs. Each shard's state root is committed to **the Adventure Layer** L2, using the optimistic rollup mechanism. This approach not only secures the data but also aligns it with the overall state of the network, maintaining coherence and reliability.

## Core Components & Mechanism of The Adventure Layer

**The Adventure Layer** is a cutting-edge Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution specifically designed to meet the high demands of blockchain gaming by leveraging an Optimistic rollup framework and a sharding architecture.  In addition, **the Adventure Layer** includes a dedicated Solidity game library called the Adventure Game Library (AGL) to empower developers to create fully onchain games more efficiently.

The core design of **The Adventure Layer** aims to provide a scalable, efficient, and secure gaming environment by deploying an advanced sharding system, the **Shard-Sharing State**, alongside an **Optimistic Rollup** mechanism for settling transactions on Ethereum L1. This architecture ensures rapid processing speeds, high transaction throughput, and low operational costs, all while maintaining compliance with the security and decentralization principles of the main Ethereum network. The optimistic rollup serves as the functional layer of **The Adventure Layer**, handling the aggregation and execution of transactions off-chain while ensuring their eventual consistency and finality on Ethereum L1.

**Components**:

- **Batch Processor**: Aggregates multiple transactions into batches for off-chain execution, significantly reducing the load on Ethereum L1 and lowering gas costs.
    
- **Data Transport Layer**: Facilitates the secure and efficient transfer of transaction data between L1 and L2, ensuring integrity and timely updates.
    
- **State Committer**: Regularly commits the state root of all processed transactions back to Ethereum L1, leveraging the security of the main blockchain for final state validation.

**Functionality**:

This module enables **The Adventure Layer** to process a high volume of transactions with minimal delay, offering an ideal environment for real-time gaming applications. The optimistic rollup also allows for a simplified dispute resolution mechanism, where only the challenged transaction data will be processed for verification, enhancing the overall efficiency.

### Sharding Module

The sharding module enhances the scalability of **The Adventure Layer** by distributing the transaction load across multiple more minor, more manageable operational units or shards.

**Components**:

- **Shard Manager**: Dynamically allocates transactions to various shards based on load and computational complexity, optimizing resource usage across the network.
    
- **Cross-Shard Communication System**: Enables seamless interaction between shards, ensuring data consistency and integrity without sacrificing operational speed.
    
- **Shared State Architecture**: This architecture maintains a coherent view of the state across all shards, facilitated by the Shard-Sharing State infrastructure, which supports real-time, cross-shard read/write operations.
    
- **Shard Forking System**: Introduces a seamless transition mechanism between Playground and Player shards that allows game developers to easily clone the state and progress of a game from a Playground shard to a Player shard for smooth upgrades and iterations of games without disrupting the player experience and facilitates rapid deployment of new features and bug fixes directly into live environments after thorough testing.

	- **Playground Shards**: Serve as development environments where game developers can test and refine game mechanics, smart contracts, and interactions without affecting the live game environments. They provide a sandbox for experimentation and debugging.
	    
	- **Player Shards**: Hold actual games as the operational shards. These shards run in production mode, ensuring that players experience optimal performance and stability.
    

**Functionality**:

By segmenting the network into multiple shards, **The Adventure Layer** can handle an exponentially larger number of transactions, making it suitable for massively multiplayer online games and complex decentralized applications. The Shared State Architecture ensures that despite the distributed nature of sharding, all parts of the network remain synchronized, providing a unified and stable gaming experience.

#### Detailed Design of State Synchronization

The Shard-Sharing State revolutionizes how states are managed and synchronized in a sharded blockchain environment, employing two distinct yet complementary mechanisms:

1. **State Synchronization Between Adventure Layer L2 and Shards**:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdWJxhUj9m0prWr1eOXTTYOiH7BiCcInWWDvniCV4MoBJhH1jJ1zp4Yd0GY8PCVLAcvlboNAf4M0IeBqN1Kgb_CskWp7RXO5yH9rA5bU8iUI7mnjMdnIA82fZd77TLhQjsz5Gp2jIFQlbwsAg59?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

**State Cache Module**: Positioned atop the state database, this module acts as an intermediary that intercepts storage access commands (SSTORE/SLOAD). When a shard accesses storage, it first queries the state cache module to check if the required state is already cached. This mechanism ensures that the most recent state from L2 is available to the shards in a read-only format to maintain data consistency and prevent direct shard-to-L2 state modifications.

This design allows smart contracts deployed on shards to access and process L2 assets, like reading balances, without risking the consistency of the L2 state. It provides a real-time, consistent view of the L2 state across all shards, enhancing the responsiveness and dynamism of gaming and other applications on **The Adventure Layer**.

2. **State Synchronization Among Shards**:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPuqTweEFZS0C4nBfbbHUj3cOkffh-v16AHh32PFBY2yzWuExAaAaqdOf97dICvSYPkzuovcGdlq_i4HNsJZaxcqLxYPLkENhZ2K3sbhJlwOSwCLEZcwhNx8LPWonFG_iIFAncRn4LSMZONr7bVQ?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

**Shared State Smart Contract**: A specialized smart contract on L2 allows developers to create shared addresses. These addresses facilitate a controlled state-sharing mechanism across shards. A shard that "borrows" a shared address gains write access to the associated state, ensuring that only one shard can modify the state at a time. Once the state is released, another shard can borrow and modify it.

This innovative approach maintains state integrity and allows for efficient, dynamic sharing of state information. It empowers developers to design more complex, interactive applications that require state interactions across multiple shards, such as large-scale decentralized games or interconnected financial services.

  
#### Benefits of the Shard-Sharing State in The Adventure Layer

The Shard-Sharing State positions **The Adventure Layer** at the forefront of blockchain innovation, particularly in the realm of decentralized gaming. The benefits of this sophisticated state synchronization mechanism include:

- **Enhanced Interoperability & Composability**: By allowing seamless state sharing across shards and between shards and the L2, the Shard-Sharing State enables a variety of applications to operate cohesively within one single shared state while ensuring that their part of their own state isn’t affected by external parties. This is particularly beneficial for complex game mechanics that rely on interactions across different game environments.
    
- **Consistent and Reliable Data Access**: The use of a state cache and controlled state-sharing ensures that all operations are based on the most current and consistent data available. This reliability is crucial for trust and security in applications that handle assets or sensitive data across multiple blockchain shards.
    
- **Scalability Without Compromise**: Typically, increased blockchain scalability comes at the cost of reduced security or increased complexity. The Shard-Sharing State provides a scalable architecture that maintains a high level of security and simplifies development challenges, making it easier for developers to build and scale applications.
    
- **Flexible state update**: For gaming, this technology allows the creation of expansive, immersive worlds with real-time asset and state updates that can be securely managed and synchronized across different game shards. Gamers experience smooth, consistent gameplay even as actions and assets are handled across multiple blockchain shards.
    
- **Foundation for Future Innovations**: The Shard-Sharing State serves current needs and lays a foundational technology that can be expanded for future blockchain applications. Its flexible, robust design anticipates future developments in blockchain technology, ensuring **The Adventure Layer** remains at the cutting edge.
    

In summary, the Shard-Sharing State within **The Adventure Layer** represents a significant leap forward in blockchain technology, offering scalability and composability. This makes it a particularly promising technology in the crypto space, setting new standards for what gaming-specific blockchain can achieve.

#### Performance Metrics in the Shard Module

The introduction of a shared state module in the Shard architecture of **The Adventure Layer** represents a significant enhancement in the execution efficiency of smart contracts within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This section provides a detailed analysis of how this module impacts performance metrics, particularly focusing on transaction throughput and efficiency in executing storage-intensive operations.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe30QtELPdwfUc6u724jhkxXRNGmaZ_oL0R0601LH5AmqB1Ae0adD4v9KmGtzIzqhwKAV0Kot2py33zLACl7STTJ3Jz9G33sxWir9ScqOLgJIyiRxqhMXcv3se2hvkDIdlkyWtlQeg5Eq_UDLTQSg?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

##### Impact of Optimized Storage Operations
  
In the traditional EVM setup, certain instructions are known to have substantial performance implications due to their intensive I/O operations. These include:

- **Initialization (Contract Load) 11.1%**
- **SLOAD (Storage Load) 22.8%**
- **SSTORE (Storage Store) 3.8%**
- **CALL (Calling External Contracts) 16.6%**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd5dgXcxDrUvTPAATVRWFgRC7XCB0gmtTJwNSfDpeHIMbe0NgVjqQ4QB5rOZwbIQcQRIUkNV6l6hAoEYV5Hw_mysLyYpXFKC9KcS5Cpi01YR_OUr800KwewDVFIlpHa2z4sSyvFs182LWdrbgHI?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ "Chart")

These operations are critically tied to how data is managed and accessed during smart contract execution, often becoming bottlenecks in terms of performance due to their dependency on state storage and retrieval.

By implementing a shared state module within each shard of **The Adventure Layer**, we introduce a caching mechanism specifically designed to optimize these I/O-bound operations. The cache serves as an intermediate layer that reduces the frequency and volume of direct reads and writes to the underlying storage system, significantly speeding up data access times and reducing latency.
  

**Performance Improvements**:

- The caching mechanism primarily impacts operations that involve data storage and retrieval (SLOAD/SSTORE), which are ubiquitous in smart contract execution. The shard's transaction processing speed (TPS) is enhanced by mitigating the data access overhead.

- Preliminary estimates suggest that the shard TPS can improve by approximately 155.52% over legacy EVM implementations that do not employ similar state caching strategies. This estimation is based on benchmarks conducted in controlled test environments, reflecting the reduction in average response time for state-dependent EVM instructions.



##### Calculating Overall TPS of The Adventure Layer

To accurately measure the overall transaction throughput of **The Adventure Layer**, we consider both the individual shard performance and the cross-shard interactions, which may introduce additional overheads due to the necessity of maintaining state consistency across the network.

**TPS Calculation Formula**:

Overall TPS=n=1N(TPSShard(n)-TPSShard(n)Interoperability Overhead %Shard(n))

Where:

- TPSShard(n) Is the transaction per second rate of the nth shard under isolated conditions
    
- Interoperability Overhead %Shard(n) is the percentage reduction in TPS due to the overhead introduced by necessary interactions between this shard and others in the network (e.g., for state synchronization and cross-shard calls).
    

This formula provides a comprehensive view of the network's capacity by accounting for the enhancements within individual shards and the systemic overhead caused by shard interoperability. The net effect is a realistic portrayal of the network's operational efficiency, reflecting both the gains from localized optimizations and the costs associated with maintaining a cohesive and synchronized multi-shard environment.

The strategic implementation of a shared state module and an efficient caching system in the shards of **The Adventure Layer** significantly elevates the performance metrics of smart contract execution. By optimizing the most critical and performance-impacting operations, the network achieves high individual shard throughput and maintains robust overall performance, even when accounting for interoperability overheads. This technical sophistication underscores **The Adventure Layer**'s capability to deliver a scalable, high-performance blockchain infrastructure suitable for complex and demanding applications like decentralized gaming.

**Functionality**

By segmenting the network into multiple shards, **The Adventure Layer** can handle an exponentially larger number of transactions, making it suitable for massively multiplayer online games and complex decentralized applications. The Shared State Architecture ensures that despite the distributed nature of sharding, all parts of the network remain synchronized, providing a unified and stable gaming experience.

### Adventure Game Library (AGL)

**The Adventure Layer** includes a dedicated Solidity game library to empower developers to efficiently create fully onchain games(FOCGs). This library is rooted in classic MUD principles but extended with modern architectural patterns such as the Entity Component System (ECS), which supports a more modular and scalable approach to game development.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeA663YfJkx3TxZTsEHpv2iSyQR1pfyupMvosWMxjqBFXweS1MK7gFR8AiZzCWflKif47rVc4Nmshc0raPsPPXso1dGeh4BLmH3_d0qRMBUCKkW-CATHw6lx3bSNDpfhBRzMbOqBdrgX-PABx3K?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

**Components**:

- **ECS Framework**: This flexible structure allows game entities to be composed of separate components (data containers) and systems (logic processors) rather than inheriting from a monolithic class hierarchy. This design facilitates easier updates and better performance scalability.
    
- **Game Development Kits (GDKs)**: Pre-built templates and tools that help developers quickly start building games by providing common game mechanics and systems, such as inventory management, character progression, and real-time combat systems.
    
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Standardized contracts that can be used or extended for typical game functions, including tokenization of assets, handling of in-game purchases, and rules for player interactions.
    

#### Enhancements with Parallel Ticking System

In traditional game development, the concept of "ticking" is fundamental, serving as the heartbeat of any interactive application. A tick refers to a single iteration of the game loop, where various elements of the game—such as physics calculations, AI decisions, player inputs, and rendering updates—are processed. This mechanism ensures that the game world remains dynamic and responsive to user interactions and systemic changes. The frequency of these ticks, or the tick rate, directly influences the fluidity and responsiveness of the gameplay experience. Higher tick rates can lead to smoother animations and more precise control, which are crucial in fast-paced games that demand quick reflexes and timely decision-making.

However, as games become more complex, featuring vast worlds filled with intricate interactions and numerous entities, the computational load of processing each tick increases significantly. Managing this computational load efficiently becomes even more challenging in decentralized environments like blockchain-based gaming, where game logic must be validated across a distributed network. The need to maintain a consistent and high-performance tick rate without overloading network resources or compromising gameplay quality is a critical concern. This is where innovative solutions such as the Parallel Ticking System come into play, addressing these challenges head-on by optimizing how game logic is executed across the distributed nodes of a blockchain network.

The **Adventure Game Library (AGL)** in **The Adventure Layer** is a pivotal component designed to empower developers to create FOCGs. Building upon the foundation of classic MUD principles and incorporating the modern Entity Component System (ECS), AGL supports a highly modular and scalable approach to game development. A significant enhancement to this architecture is the introduction of the **Parallel Ticking System**. This system is meticulously designed to optimize the performance of game logic execution across multiple cores within each shard, enabling high-performance, real-time gaming experiences.

  
#### Design of the Parallel Ticking System

The Parallel Ticking System is structured to maximize the computational efficiency and scalability of the gaming environment in **The Adventure Layer**. Here’s how the system is designed:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdEpXXV_-ZZcaag3KmLh7aNzUdZaMfXmjtI06TjOR4r9Tk1fcHU_Xii5Nip6WHvK2YCx4ot4YxoKEza-8LwwEz4AX2c2fEADZSMCQK8UxuszGfh3IovpzmgweofKGCHK9NwOXgcBSdkN-IA1JjsFg?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

  
1. **Namespace-based Component Storage**:

   - Each game component is instantiated with a unique global namespace within a Merkle tree-like storage structure. Each entity within the game has a designated namespace, and all properties and states related to that entity are initialized under this namespace. This arrangement ensures organized and secure data management.

2. **Stateless Component Design**:

   - Each component operates as a stateless program, taking its namespace as input. The output from each component is a vector of state changes restricted to its own namespace and events that may interact with different namespace components. This design ensures that each component's logic is self-contained, enhancing reliability and ease of updates.

3. **Parallel Component Ticking**:

   - The ticking process, which updates component states, occurs in parallel across all shards within **The Adventure Layer**. At the start of each block, validators collect all components requiring ticking services for that frame. Since each component accesses only its namespace state, there are no conflicts during execution, allowing for true parallel processing.

4. **Sorting and Application of Changes**:

   - Once the parallel ticking has been executed, the resulting group vectors of state changes and events are sorted and systematically applied to the appropriate components in the storage system. This step ensures that all state transitions are handled accurately and efficiently.

5. **Performance Optimization**:

   - By implementing the Parallel Ticking System, **The Adventure Layer** fully utilizes the multicore architecture of modern servers. This allows the shards to run active game logic while retaining ultra-high performance, which is crucial for maintaining fluid and responsive gameplay in complex onchain games.

#### Benefits of the Parallel Ticking System

The introduction of the Parallel Ticking System within the AGL provides several key advantages:

- **Enhanced Performance**: By enabling parallel game logic processing, the system significantly reduces latency and increases throughput, essential for real-time interactive gaming experiences.

- **Scalability**: The stateless design and namespace-based component management allow the system to scale efficiently as game complexity and player numbers increase.

- **Flexibility and Modularity**: The component design's self-contained nature allows developers to easily add or modify components without impacting other parts of the game.

- **Robust Data Integrity**: The use of Merkle tree-like storage ensures that all game states are secure and verifiable, enhancing the gaming platform's overall security.

 - **Only available under ECS architecture**: A simplified way to understand our parallel ticking system design is that it is a globally synchronized transaction initiator, where all components assigned to the same system will initiate transactions to update their state in a parallelized way. This benefits all the applications designed under the ECS framework, which is an industry standard in the gaming space.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdu8UWqNZ0K1uDi3Jox9WIHiO6K594OVRvbNmJ24bV57iPyo-aVnI4unw30XT6DFzNMzO_ePZ5KIXvjQbqQjGaY3E780Iew3RydeVfISx1sNTA4r_QZPQBdqbwlXauIwHtlYa-BwZgtTb_0zWAc?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

This architectural enhancement positions **The Adventure Layer** as a leading platform for blockchain-based gaming, setting new standards for performance and scalability in the industry. By leveraging modern server architectures to their fullest potential, the Parallel Ticking System offers a promising solution to the challenges of onchain game development.

### Enhancing The Adventure Layer with Advanced Data Availability and Financialization Solutions

#### Customized Data Availability Solutions Using Erasure Coding

In blockchain systems, particularly those employing sharding, maintaining data availability (DA) is crucial to ensure that data remains accessible and resilient to node failures or adversarial behaviors. **The Adventure Layer** introduces a sophisticated approach to this issue by implementing a customized DA solution for each shard, leveraging Erasure Coding—a method proven to significantly enhance data resiliency and accessibility.

**Erasure Coding Explained**:

Erasure coding is a data protection method used extensively in distributed storage systems to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. It transforms a piece of data into a longer, more complex version through additional encoding. The data is divided into multiple fragments, extended with redundant data pieces, and distributed across different storage locations or nodes.

**In the context of blockchain sharding**:

- **Fragmentation**: Each shard’s data is fragmented into smaller pieces.

- **Redundancy**: Additional data blocks (redundant fragments) are generated using algebraic functions.

- **Distribution**: Both original and redundant fragments are distributed across a network of nodes within the shard.


**Benefits**:

- **Resilience to Data Loss**: The redundant fragments allow the reconstruction of original data even if some of the fragments are lost or corrupted, enhancing the system's robustness against node failures.

- **Improved Accessibility**: Data remains available even under conditions where network segments become isolated or when certain nodes are not operational.

- **Optimized Storage Requirements**: Erasure coding offers a more storage-efficient way to ensure data redundancy and reliability than traditional replication methods.

By customizing the erasure coding parameters for each shard based on its specific needs and transaction patterns, **The Adventure Layer** ensures that data availability is maintained efficiently and effectively, tailored to the unique demands of different gaming environments.

#### Blob Financialization Layer

Another innovative feature of **The Adventure Layer** is the introduction of the Blob Financialization Layer. This financial layer aims to mitigate the costs associated with gas fees for transactions within the sharding system by allowing game studios and other entities to hedge and fractionalize blob storage costs.

  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXedXpRTMmoV70z-JcRwdsGH4EeVSYxJdPltsyPEscS27Xzp2ZLeTaPl7SpM9tX2-oVI0OOm3DTi8lIWAgytF4irgSkU2MyE4piPX8_ZcK55jbj7bvNTRbm6VfWthpWep9OP2gK41jejtY5eFR9TCw?key=MX1cCxpr6-qyzTQezewHqQ)

**Concept of Blob Financialization**:

Blob storage in the blockchain includes large binary objects (blobs) that might be too large or inefficient to store directly on the blockchain. The financialization layer works by:

- **Tokenization of Blob Storage Costs**: Blob gas fees are converted into tradable tokens, representing a stake in the storage costs associated with specific shards or sets of transactions.

- **Hedging and Trading**: Entities can purchase and hold these tokens to hedge against future increases in blob storage costs. Conversely, they can speculate on variations in storage costs or offset their own storage expenses by trading these tokens.

- **Fractionalization**: This approach allows for the fractional ownership of storage costs, allowing smaller developers or studios to manage their financial exposure to gas fees more effectively.

**Benefits**:

- **Cost Management**: Provides a mechanism for developers to manage and mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating transaction costs.

- **Market Dynamics**: Creates a new market dynamic where storage costs can be traded, leading to more efficient pricing and allocation of blockchain resources.

- **Increased Accessibility**: This makes entry more affordable for smaller players, fostering greater innovation and participation within the blockchain gaming ecosystem.

Together, these features—Erasure Coding for Data Availability and Blob Financialization for economic management of shard resources—substantially enhance the scalability, efficiency, and economic viability of **The Adventure Layer**. By addressing both technical and financial challenges within blockchain gaming architectures, these innovations position **The Adventure Layer** as a pioneering solution capable of supporting the next generation of blockchain-based gaming applications.

## Implementation Strategy

To ensure robust and efficient operation, **The Adventure Layer** employs a phased implementation approach:
