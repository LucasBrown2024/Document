### Adventure Game Library (AGL)

**The Adventure Layer** includes a dedicated Solidity game library to empower developers to efficiently create fully onchain games(FOCGs). This library is rooted in classic MUD principles but extended with modern architectural patterns such as the Entity Component System (ECS), which supports a more modular and scalable approach to game development.

**Components**:

- **ECS Framework**: This flexible structure allows game entities to be composed of separate components (data containers) and systems (logic processors) rather than inheriting from a monolithic class hierarchy. This design facilitates easier updates and better performance scalability.
    
- **Game Development Kits (GDKs)**: Pre-built templates and tools that help developers quickly start building games by providing common game mechanics and systems, such as inventory management, character progression, and real-time combat systems.
    
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Standardized contracts that can be used or extended for typical game functions, including tokenization of assets, handling of in-game purchases, and rules for player interactions.
