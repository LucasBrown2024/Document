#### Benefits of the Parallel Ticking System

The introduction of the Parallel Ticking System within the AGL provides several key advantages:

- **Enhanced Performance**: By enabling parallel game logic processing, the system significantly reduces latency and increases throughput, essential for real-time interactive gaming experiences.

- **Scalability**: The stateless design and namespace-based component management allow the system to scale efficiently as game complexity and player numbers increase.

- **Flexibility and Modularity**: The component design's self-contained nature allows developers to easily add or modify components without impacting other parts of the game.

- **Robust Data Integrity**: The use of Merkle tree-like storage ensures that all game states are secure and verifiable, enhancing the gaming platform's overall security.

Â - **Only available under ECS architecture**: A simplified way to understand our parallel ticking system design is that it is a globally synchronized transaction initiator, where all components assigned to the same system will initiate transactions to update their state in a parallelized way. This benefits all the applications designed under the ECS framework, which is an industry standard in the gaming space.
