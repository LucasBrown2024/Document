## Security Measures

Given the dual focus on performance and security, **The Adventure Layer** incorporates several layers of security mechanisms:

- **Validator Screening and Staking**: Validators are carefully selected based on their computational capabilities and staked tokens, which are at risk in the event of malicious actions or failure to validate transactions correctly.
    
- **Fraud Proofs**: In the event of disputes or suspicious transactions, the optimistic rollup framework allows for fraud proofs to be submitted, which are verified against the data committed on Ethereum L1.
    
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities within the network.
